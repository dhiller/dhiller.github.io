KubeVirt - Making Running Virtual Machines in a Kubernetes Cluster a Mainstream Activity

Daniel Hiller, Red Hat

KubeVirt is a K8S addon for running VMs inside a K8S cluster. Currently being in CNCF incubating state, it has a wide range of adopters by both vendors and end users, such as NVidia, Suse, Arm and Red Hat to name a few. This talk aims to give an overview of what is currently possible with KubeVirt on your cluster and what its future may look like. A live demo will show some of the features it supports, i.e. VM Import, LiveMigration, Snapshot/Restore and Monitoring. At the end of the talk attendees will have an idea of how they can use it to better integrate existing virtual machines with containers in their existing application landscape.
