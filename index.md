Hey there, I'm Daniel Hiller.

I'm currently part of the [KubeVirt community](https://kubevirt.io/), where I maintain, improve and automate CI using [Prow](https://docs.prow.k8s.io/docs/overview/) on [Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.io/) and [Golang](https://go.dev/) for various things.

Previously I've worked with Java, Jenkins, AWS, RDBMS and other things, see my [history](/history.html) for more.

I transform â˜• into useful stuff for others.

I focus heavily on automation to avoid tedious repeatable tasks. I firmly believe that it's the purpose of my profession to automate all the things so everyone can benefit from it. This very much manifests in how I work.

Therefore I use:
* automated testing
* software metrics
* continuous integration and deployments
* infrastructure as code
* workflow automation
