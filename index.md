Hey there, I'm Daniel Hiller.

I'm currently working on [KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io/), where I maintain the CI system using Kubernetes and Go. Previously my main workhorses have been Java, Spring Boot, Jenkins, Bash and AWS.

I strive to create software that is useful for people so they can get their job done in less time and with less effort. This hopefully leads to people having time to think about how they can work more efficiently, thus getting better in doing their job.

I focus heavily on automation to avoid tedious repeatable tasks over and over again. I strongly believe that it's the purpose of my profession to automate all the things so everyone can benefit from it. This very much manifests in how I work.

I strongly believe in:
* automated testing
* software metrics
* continuous integration and deployments
* infrastructure as code
* workflow automation
