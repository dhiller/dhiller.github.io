title: Formatting curl xml result via xmllint
---

So I got fed up recently when reloading a url to check an xml result using chrome because I was using HTTP basic authentication also. Chrome was annoying me because each time i switched from no auth to auth I had to manually remove all browser data and restart chrome.

So I tried to use curl for that job. The only annoyance was that the xml is not formatted properly.

So xmllint for the rescue

```bash
curl 'yoururlhere' | xmllint --format -
```

and that's it.
